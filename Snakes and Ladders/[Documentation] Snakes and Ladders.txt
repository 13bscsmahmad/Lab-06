Introduction
============

This program attempts to emulate a Snakes and Ladders game, for 2-4 people. The number of people are randomly chosen between 2-4 (inclusive). It is defined by the variable "numberOfPlayers" in the main.java file.

All checks are placed in the main.java file, which take help from the methods implemented in the Board.java file, which is emulates a board, and the players.

Player.java is a class which defines the attributes of a player, namely their name, current score, and a boolean status (which tells if the player is blocked or not).

Dice.java implements the functionality of a dice, randomly generating numbers between 1-6 (inclusive).

Novelity in Approach
====================

The code tries to follow OOP, wherein each object in the game is represented by a class in Java. It implements native data structures such as Lists<>.

How to Run the Application
==========================

There are 4 files in the src/ directory:

- main.java
- Board.java
- Player.java
- Dice.java

Compile all using "javac main.java Board.java Player.java Dice.java".
Run "java main.java" to start the application. Since the application is automatic and requires no user input, it will run until any player reaches the 100th position.

The application runs 100 times, and displays the avg. number of rounds, maximum number of rounds, and minimum number of rounds. A round is completed once every player has had a turn exactly one time (excluding the re-runs for sixes and ladders).
